I am an undergraduate cyber security researcher working under the supervision of Prof. Anam Qureshi, PhD.

Currently, I’m in my junior (3rd) year at FAST NUCES Karachi pursuing a bachelor’s degree in cyber security.

In my free time, I play ctfs and (try to) document everything I learn and build so that I can reflect upon my journey (and maybe inspire fellow cyber security researchers). You can read my writing [here](/posts/).

If you want to get in touch with me about something or just to say hi, reach out on social media or [send me an email](mailto:hi@hafizfarhad.com).
